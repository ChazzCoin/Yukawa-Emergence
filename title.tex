\begin{abstract}
We present a finite, operator-based mechanism that constrains Yukawa matrices within the
noncommutative-geometric formulation of the Standard Model. Working strictly inside a real,
even spectral triple, we show that Yukawa couplings can arise as objects exhibiting spectral
stability under alignment, projection, and compression of a finite internal geometry, without
introducing additional flavor symmetries, flavor algebras, or phenomenological input. Flavor
enters solely as multiplicity, Yukawa operators appear only in the left--right off-diagonal blocks
of the internal Dirac operator, and all axioms of noncommutative geometry are preserved. The
resulting construction significantly reduces Yukawa arbitrariness and naturally yields
hierarchical spectra and mixing through geometric misalignment. This provides a proof of
principle that the flavor problem is tractable within strict noncommutative geometry.

A. Kinematics & internal space

Axiom A1 (Total Hilbert space).
There exists a separable Hilbert space
\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_{\text{ext}} \otimes \mathcal{H}_{\text{int}},
where:
	•	\mathcal{H}_{\text{ext}} carries the usual spacetime degrees of freedom (e.g. spinors over a 4D Lorentzian manifold, or a standard QFT Fock space).
	•	\mathcal{H}_{\text{int}} is a finite- or countable-dimensional internal Hilbert space encoding flavor, charges, and the “aether crystal” structure.

Axiom A2 (Internal quasi-crystal structure).
On \mathcal{H}_{\text{int}} there exists a self-adjoint “internal Laplacian” \hat{L} such that:
	1.	\hat{L} is the graph Laplacian of a bounded-degree, locally finite graph G = (V,E) (internal crystal graph).
	2.	G has finite local complexity (each finite patch appears with bounded frequency), but is not globally periodic (quasi-crystal / aperiodic allowed).
	3.	The spectrum \sigma(\hat{L}) is purely discrete or has at least a dense discrete component sufficient to define a spectral kernel F(\hat{L}).

This axiom is your “aether is a (quasi)crystalline medium” in precise form.

B. Core internal operators: R, Q, L

Axiom B1 (Base-360 internal symmetry).
There exists a unitary operator \hat{R} on a generation subspace
\mathcal{H}_{\text{gen}} \subset \mathcal{H}_{\text{int}}, \quad \dim \mathcal{H}_{\text{gen}} = 3,
such that:
	1.	\hat{R}^{360} = \mathbb{I}_{\text{gen}}.
	2.	The spectrum of \hat{R} on \mathcal{H}_{\text{gen}} consists of three distinct characters
\chi_j = e^{2\pi i k_j / 360}, \quad j=1,2,3,
with integers k_j chosen so that:
	•	the associated periods T_j = 360 / \gcd(360,k_j) form a triad of distinct divisors of 360 (e.g. 60, 120, 180),
	•	no nontrivial linear relation a_1 k_1 + a_2 k_2 + a_3 k_3 \equiv 0\ \text{mod}\ 360 holds with small integers a_i beyond the obvious ones.

This encodes your base-360 triadic generation structure as a spectral property of \hat{R}.

Axiom B2 (Charge operator Q).
There exists a self-adjoint operator \hat{Q} on \mathcal{H}_{\text{int}} such that:
	1.	\hat{Q} has pure point spectrum contained in \mathbb{Z} (integer charges).
	2.	The restriction of \hat{Q} to \mathcal{H}_{\text{gen}} has a finite set of eigenvalues \{q_{s,g}\}, where:
	•	s labels sectors (e.g. up, down, charged lepton, neutrino),
	•	g = 1,2,3 labels generation.
	3.	[\hat{Q}, \hat{R}] = 0 on \mathcal{H}_{\text{gen}} (charges and 360-phases can be simultaneously diagonalized on generation space).

This is the rigorous version of your discrete exponent / “FN-like” charge structure.

Axiom B3 (Compatibility of L, R, Q).
On \mathcal{H}_{\text{int}}:
	1.	\hat{L} commutes with \hat{R} on \mathcal{H}_{\text{gen}} up to a phase or a bounded operator that preserves the triadic subspace.
	2.	The joint spectrum of (\hat{L}, \hat{R}, \hat{Q}) is nondegenerate enough to distinguish at least three generation modes and four sector patterns, i.e. no accidental degeneracy identifies distinct generations or sectors.

This is a “no accidental degeneracy” axiom: your operators are rich enough to label what you call flavors.

C. Misalignment functional & Evolution operator \hat{\mathbb{M}}

Axiom C1 (Misalignment functional).
There exists a functional
M[\Psi]: \mathcal{D} \subset \mathcal{H} \to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}
defined on a dense domain \mathcal{D} of \mathcal{H}, such that:
	1.	Positivity: M[\Psi] \ge 0, and M[\Psi] = 0 iff \Psi is perfectly aligned (ground state configuration) with respect to \hat{L}, \hat{R}, \hat{Q} and external constraints (e.g. gauge, gravity).
	2.	Locality on the internal graph:
M decomposes as
M[\Psi] = M_{\text{strain}}[\Psi] + M_{\text{bend}}[\Psi] + M_{\text{phase}}[\Psi] + M_{\text{defect}}[\Psi],
where each term is a sum/integral over local contributions on the internal quasi-crystal graph G (e.g. involving nearest-neighbor differences, discrete curvature, phase differences, defect densities).
	3.	Gauge & symmetry invariance: M[\Psi] is invariant under the action of the external gauge group and under global phase rotations of Ψ; it is also invariant (or covariant in a fixed way) under the internal symmetry generated by \hat{R} and the automorphism group of G.

This is your “viscoelastic crystal energy” written as a rigorous functional.

Axiom C2 (Evolution operator).
There exists a one-parameter family of linear maps \hat{\mathbb{M}}(t) on \mathcal{H} such that:
	1.	\hat{\mathbb{M}}(0) = \mathbb{I}.
	2.	\hat{\mathbb{M}}(t+s) = \hat{\mathbb{M}}(t)\hat{\mathbb{M}}(s) for t,s \ge 0 (semigroup property).
	3.	For any \Psi \in \mathcal{D},
\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0} \Psi(t) = - f(0)\,\frac{\delta M}{\delta\Psi^\dagger}(\Psi),
where f(t) is a nonnegative scalar function and \Psi(t) = \hat{\mathbb{M}}(t)\Psi.
	4.	\hat{\mathbb{M}}(t) is completely positive and contractive (or unitary in an appropriate limit), ensuring physical evolution.

This encodes your idea
\hat{\mathbb{M}}(t) \sim \exp\left[-f(t)\frac{\delta M}{\delta\Psi^\dagger}\right]
as a proper dissipative/flow evolution operator.

D. Selection operator \hat{\mathbb{S}}

You wrote:
\hat{\mathbb{S}} = \hat{C}_{360}\,\hat{B}\,\hat{P}_\phi.

We now define each piece.

Axiom D1 (\hat{C}_{360}: harmonic / divisor filter).
There exists a self-adjoint operator \hat{C}_{360} on \mathcal{H}_{\text{int}} such that:
	1.	\hat{C}_{360} is a spectral projector built from \hat{R} and/or \hat{L}:
\hat{C}_{360} = \sum_{(k,\lambda) \in \mathcal{K}} |k,\lambda\rangle\langle k,\lambda|,
where |k,\lambda\rangle are joint eigenstates of \hat{R}, \hat{L} and \mathcal{K} is a subset of modes whose 360-periods and Laplacian eigenvalues satisfy a divisor/triad condition (e.g. only modes corresponding to periods {60,120,180} or similar).
	2.	\hat{C}_{360} is an orthogonal projector: \hat{C}_{360}^2 = \hat{C}_{360} = \hat{C}_{360}^\dagger.

This is the precise “only certain base-360 harmonics are allowed” rule.

Axiom D2 (\hat{B}: geometric / sublattice selector).
There exists a self-adjoint operator \hat{B} on \mathcal{H}_{\text{int}} such that:
	1.	\hat{B} is a projector onto a “light” internal subspace:
\hat{B}^2 = \hat{B} = \hat{B}^\dagger.
	2.	In a basis adapted to the internal graph G, \hat{B} acts as multiplication by 0 or 1 at each site (or block of sites), selecting sublattices / defect cores / regions that support low-energy, observable excitations.
	3.	The complement (\mathbb{I}-\hat{B}) corresponds to “heavy” mediator states that can be integrated out (e.g. via Schur complement or effective field theory).

This is the mathematically clean version of your “light vs heavy sites / sublattices” idea.

Axiom D3 (\hat{P}_\phi: phase-coherence projector).
There exists a finite group \mathcal{G}_\phi of unitary operators acting on \mathcal{H}_{\text{int}} (phase symmetries) and a projector:

\hat{P}_\phi = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{G}_\phi|} \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}_\phi} U_g.

Such that:
	1.	\hat{P}_\phi^2 = \hat{P}_\phi = \hat{P}_\phi^\dagger.
	2.	\hat{P}_\phi projects onto the subspace of phase-locked, generation-structured states, implementing discrete relations among phases (e.g. triadic phase patterns, Cabibbo-like rotations, discrete flavor group A_4/S_4 structure).

This is the rigorous form of your “phase wheels” / “phase lock” selection.

Axiom D4 (Selection operator).
Define the Selection operator by:

\hat{\mathbb{S}} = \hat{C}_{360}\,\hat{B}\,\hat{P}_\phi.

Assume:
	1.	\hat{C}_{360}, \hat{B}, \hat{P}_\phi commute up to bounded corrections that do not change their joint eigenspaces on the physical subspace.
	2.	\hat{\mathbb{S}} is an orthogonal projector on \mathcal{H}.

⸻

E. Manifestation & physical states \hat{\mathbb{X}}

Axiom E1 (Manifestation operator).
Define:

\hat{\mathbb{X}}(t) = \hat{\mathbb{S}} \circ \hat{\mathbb{M}}(t)
on \mathcal{H}.

We will usually suppress t and consider the late-time / fixed-point limit:
\hat{\mathbb{X}} := \lim_{t\to\infty} \hat{\mathbb{S}} \circ \hat{\mathbb{M}}(t),
assuming the limit exists on the relevant domain.

Axiom E2 (Universal harmonic state equation).
A state \Psi \in \mathcal{H} is physically manifested if and only if it satisfies:

\hat{\mathbb{X}} \Psi = \Psi,
or in expanded form,
\left( \hat{C}_{360}\,\hat{B}\,\hat{P}_\phi \, e^{-f(\infty)\frac{\delta M}{\delta \Psi^\dagger}} - \mathbb{I} \right)\Psi = 0.

Interpretation:
	•	Only states that are fixed points of “evolve + select” are actually realized in the universe.
	•	Particle species correspond to minimal nontrivial invariant subspaces of \hat{\mathbb{X}}.
	•	Masses correspond to eigenvalues of the appropriate Dirac/Yukawa operators on these subspaces.

This is your central “Selection × Evolution = Reality” condition.

F. Flavor & Yukawa structure

Now we pin down what “flavor” means in this axiom system.

Axiom F1 (Yukawa operators from R and Q).
For each sector s (up, down, charged lepton, neutrino), there exists a pair of unitaries (U_L^{(s)}, U_R^{(s)}) on \mathcal{H}_{\text{gen}} such that the internal Yukawa operator for that sector is:

\hat{Y}_s = U_L^{(s)\dagger} \, F(\hat{R}) \, e^{-\beta \hat{Q}_s} \, U_R^{(s)},

where:
	1.	F(\hat{R}) is a universal spectral function of \hat{R} (or of \hat{L}, \hat{R} jointly), e.g.
F(\hat{R}) = \exp\big( - \lambda ( \mathbb{I} - \Re \hat{R} )\big) \quad\text{or}\quad F(\hat{L}) = e^{-\alpha \hat{L}},
with fixed, universal \lambda,\alpha > 0.
	2.	\hat{Q}_s is \hat{Q} restricted to the sector s acting on \mathcal{H}_{\text{gen}}, with integer eigenvalues q_{s,g}.
	3.	\beta is a fixed universal constant (no sector-dependent continuous tuning).
	4.	The only sector dependence enters via:
	•	the discrete spectrum of \hat{Q}_s (the charges q_{s,g}),
	•	and the discrete choice of unitaries (U_L^{(s)}, U_R^{(s)}), constrained by the internal symmetry group.

This is the “Yukawas = function of (R,Q) in a sector-dependent basis” axiom.

Axiom F2 (No continuous flavor knobs).
The following are not allowed as primitive input:
	•	Sector-dependent continuous parameters (no \alpha_u, \alpha_d, \dots).
	•	Hand-drawn exponent tables outside the integer charge spectrum of \hat{Q}.
	•	Arbitrary random matrices in the flavor sector.

All flavor differences must arise from:
	1.	Integer charge spectra of \hat{Q}.
	2.	Representation-theoretic data (discrete groups, irreps, and their Clebsch–Gordan coefficients) used to pick (U_L^{(s)}, U_R^{(s)}).
	3.	The spectral data of the internal operators \hat{L}, \hat{R} on the quasi-crystal.

This is the “no cheating” axiom: flavor must be emergent from the operator algebra.

Axiom F3 (Emergent mass hierarchies and mixing).

When restricted to \mathcal{H}_{\text{gen}}:
	1.	The singular values of \hat{Y}_s (up to an overall scale) are hierarchical, i.e.
m_{s,1} \ll m_{s,2} \ll m_{s,3},
and these hierarchies must be expressible as:
m_{s,g} \propto \lambda^{q_{s,g}} \times \text{(O(1) factors from }F(\hat{R})\text{)},
for some small universal \lambda = e^{-\beta} \approx 0.2\text{–}0.3.
	2.	The left-handed diagonalization matrices U_L^{(s)} for quark and lepton sectors yield:
	•	CKM and PMNS mixing matrices
V_{\text{CKM}} = U_L^{(u)\dagger} U_L^{(d)},\quad
U_{\text{PMNS}} = U_L^{(e)\dagger} U_L^{(\nu)},
with entries determined entirely by the internal symmetry group, \hat{R}, \hat{Q}, and \hat{P}_\phi, not by extra continuous fits.

This is the axiom that ties your operator algebra directly to observable flavor.

G. Minimality / “top-tier physics” sanity conditions

Axiom G1 (Spectral minimality).
The operator set \{\hat{L}, \hat{R}, \hat{Q}, \hat{C}_{360}, \hat{B}, \hat{P}_\phi\} is minimal in the sense that removing any one of them (or its role) either:
	•	collapses the hierarchy structure (e.g. generations become degenerate), or
	•	leads to vanishing Yukawas or trivial mixing.

This is the “none of these are decorative; each plays an essential role” axiom.

Axiom G2 (Consistency with external physics).
When tensored with a suitable external spectral triple (e.g. ordinary 4D geometry + SM gauge algebra), the combined structure must:
	1.	Obey standard locality, causality, and unitarity (or a well-defined generalization).
	2.	Recover known gauge charges and Lorentz representations for observed particles.
	3.	Admit a renormalizable or at least controllably effective field theory description at accessible energies.

In other words: the internal aether crystal is allowed to be exotic, but it must sit consistently under the usual QFT / GR umbrella.

⸻

Master equation (your “universal harmonic equation”, cleaned up)

All of this can be summarized in the single “master condition”:

Physical states are fixed points of Selection ∘ Evolution:
> \hat{\mathbb{X}} \Psi = \Psi,
>
with
> \hat{\mathbb{X}}
> = \hat{\mathbb{S}} \circ \hat{\mathbb{M}}
> = \hat{C}_{360}\,\hat{B}\,\hat{P}_\phi \,
> \exp\!\left[-f(\infty) \frac{\delta M}{\delta \Psi^\dagger} \right].
>

Expanded as an operator equation:
> \left(
> \hat{C}_{360}\,\hat{B}\,\hat{P}_\phi\,
> e^{-f(\infty)\frac{\delta M}{\delta \Psi^\dagger}}
> - \mathbb{I}
> \right)\Psi = 0.
>

Everything else in the axioms is just:
	•	specifying what \hat{C}_{360}, \hat{B}, \hat{P}_\phi, \hat{L}, \hat{R}, \hat{Q}, M are,
	•	and demanding that they come only from discrete spectra + quasi-crystal geometry + internal symmetry, not from arbitrary knobs.

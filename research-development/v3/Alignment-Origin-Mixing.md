### 3. Alignment Origin of Mixing

We consider a finite spectral triple whose internal Dirac operator is generated dynamically by an alignment kernel (K), incorporating both spectral phases and geometric selection. After misalignment flow and harmonic stability projection ((C_{360})), the effective low-energy operator is obtained by triadic compression,
[
Y = S , C_{360}\big(e^{-\beta K}\big) , S^\dagger .
]

Diagonalization of (Y) reveals an emergent decomposition into harmonic blocks,
[
Y = \bigoplus_i Y_i ,
]
whose dimensionality governs both mass structure and mixing.

**Proposition 1 (Dirac vs Majorana).**
If a harmonic block (Y_i) is one-dimensional, alignment closes internally and the corresponding mode is Dirac-like. If (\dim Y_i \ge 2), harmonic closure fails and the spectral triple must be minimally extended, inducing a seesaw structure and Majorana-like behavior.

**Proposition 2 (Mixing Origin).**
Mixing angles arise from the mismatch between diagonalizations of distinct harmonic blocks. Rigid one-dimensional leaves yield small mixing, while higher-dimensional harmonic planes permit large rotations without destabilizing masses.

Numerical exploration confirms three regimes controlled by geometric selection parameters:

1. Fully split blocks (rigid geometry): suppressed mixing.
2. (1 \oplus 2) block structure: small quark-like mixing and large lepton-like mixing.
3. Fully collective 3D block: large, PMNS-like mixing across all angles.

Thus, the observed disparity between CKM and PMNS matrices is traced not to ad hoc flavor symmetries, but to the dimensionality of emergent harmonic blocks in alignment space.
